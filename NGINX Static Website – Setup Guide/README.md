Nginx Static Website Deployment Project

    Project Overview
    This project demonstrates how to deploy a static website on an Nginx web server using a structured and automated approach.

It includes:

    A sample static website (HTML + CSS)
    Custom Nginx server configuration
    A deployment automation script
    Proper Linux directory structure and permissions

The goal of this project is to provide a hands-on DevOps learning example for understanding:

    Web server configuration
    Static website hosting
    Linux file permissions
    Nginx site enabling
    Basic deployment automation

File & Folder Explanation

1 css/

    Contains the website styling files.
    styles.css → Controls layout, colors, and design of the website.

2 index.html

    Main webpage file served by Nginx.
    It includes:
    Page structure
    Content
    Link to the CSS stylesheet

3 config-file

    Custom Nginx server block configuration.
    This file:
    Defines server port (8080)
    Sets website root directory (/var/www/example-project)
    Handles static file serving
    Configures access and error logs

It is copied to:

    /etc/nginx/sites-available/

and then enabled in:

    /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

4 deploy.sh

    Automation script to deploy the website.

The script performs:

    System update
    Nginx installation
    Application file deployment
    Permission configuration
    Nginx config setup
    Service restart and validation

Run with:

    sudo bash deploy.sh

5 README.md

    Project documentation file explaining setup and structure.

How Deployment Works

    Website files are copied to:
    /var/www/example-project
    
    
    Nginx configuration is activated.
    Nginx service reloads.
    
    The website becomes accessible at:
    http://localhost:8080

Learning Outcomes

    After completing this project, you will understand:
    How Nginx serves static content
    Difference between sites-available and sites-enabled
    How deployment scripts automate infrastructure tasks
    Proper Linux permission management
    Web server directory structure
